## Features
This template does not force you to integrate `boto3`,`postgres`,`docker` or any other dependancy / practices, but rather focuses on the important and crucial things,at the same time giving you options to branch out in directions with the boilerplate,it let's you deicde your pizza toppings as you develop further, while [agconti/cookiecutter-django-rest](https://github.com/agconti/cookiecutter-django-rest) changes things drastically in terms of settings,packages and project structure that i feel a need to start over.

## Usage

Let's pretend you want to create a Django project called "petstore". Rather than using `startproject`
and then editing the results to include your name, email, and various configuration issues that always get forgotten until the worst possible moment, get [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) to do all the work.

First, get Cookiecutter:

    $ pip install "cookiecutter>=1.7.0"

Now run it against this repo:

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/n0tNoah/django-cookiecutter-rest/

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Django project will be created for you.
